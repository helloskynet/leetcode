Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

给定一个字符串，找出最长的不包含重复字符的子字符串，

例如：

给定 “abcabcbb” ,结果是 “abc” 长度为3
给定 “bbbbb” ,结果是 “b” 长度为1
给定 “pwwkew” ,结果是 “wke” 长度为3

注意，答案必须是子字符串，“pwke” 是子序列而不是子字符串
